//   1. Baseline Next/TypeScript linting (next/core-web-vitals + typescript).
//   2. ARCHITECTURE BOUNDARIES — the layering rules the audit found violated
//      (core importing feature UI) are now machine-enforced. The dependency
//      direction is:
//        core ← shared ← infrastructure ← application ← features ← app
//      core depends on nothing above it and never on React.

// Run: npm run lint
