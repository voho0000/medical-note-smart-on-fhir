 * Shared colour roles for the report workspace.
 *
 * Dark mode deliberately uses a small palette in dense lists:
 * - primary blue: interaction, selection, and source links
 * - neutral secondary: report classification
 * - clinical coral: findings that require attention
 *
 * Keeping these roles here prevents each report component from introducing a
 * slightly different emerald, blue, or rose treatment.
