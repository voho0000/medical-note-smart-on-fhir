/**
 * Where every CDSS store keeps what the clinician said about a patient.
 *
 * Seven stores hold answers about one person's chart — the every-visit asks,
 * the clinic vitals and signs, the AF page's structured answers, the HF
 * phenotype gate, the HFpEF inputs, the physician's decisions, and the
 * evidence rows the physician switched on or off. Each keeps
 * its own shape and its own validation; none of them decides where its data
 * lives. That is this file's one job, so the day answers are carried to the
 * next visit, one backing is replaced here and every store follows.
 *
 * The default is today's: this tab, keyed by patient, encrypted under the tab
 * session's key (`encrypted-answer-cache.service`) — ciphertext in
 * `localStorage`, readable only by the session that wrote it, so the next
 * person at a shared workstation reads nothing. Nothing is written to the
 * chart and nothing leaves the machine.
 *
 * Carrying answers across visits is not implemented, on purpose: where they
 * would be written (the hospital's FHIR server or Firestore, under the patient
 * or the physician), how long an answer stays valid, and who may read it are
 * the owner's decisions (see `phenotype-answer.firestore.ts`). A backing that
 * writes anywhere else is a new patient-data write and says so in its commit
 * and its PR.
