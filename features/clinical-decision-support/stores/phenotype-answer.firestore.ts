/**
 * The persisted `PhenotypeAnswerRepository`, deliberately unimplemented.
 *
 * The seam it plugs into is already there — `setPhenotypeAnswerRepository` in
 * `phenotype-answer.store.ts` swaps the session implementation for this one and
 * nothing above it changes — but what this file would write is patient data, and
 * three decisions that are the owner's have not been made:
 *
 *   1. **The path.** `cdssPhenotypeAnswers/{patientId}` and
 *      `users/{uid}/cdssPhenotypeAnswers/{patientId}` are different clinical
 *      claims, not two spellings of one: the first is 「this patient's
 *      判讀」 and hands over at the bedside, the second is 「this physician's
 *      判讀」 and does not.
 *   2. **The expiry.** An LVEF reading goes stale, and how many days make a
 *      stored answer 未作答 again decides whether the card re-asks.
 *   3. **The Rules.** Firestore Rules are the authority on who may read this,
 *      and `CLAUDE.md` puts them outside what this pilot may change.
 *
 * The trade-offs and a Rules draft are written up in
 * `docs/HF-DP01_phenotype-answer-persistence-proposal.md`. Until those are
 * settled the store keeps its session-only default, so an answer lives for the
 * tab and is gone on reload — the state this pilot has approval for.
 *
 * Nothing here imports Firestore or opens a connection. Wiring it in is a
 * separate change that must also say, in its commit and its PR, that it adds a
 * patient-data write and where it writes.
