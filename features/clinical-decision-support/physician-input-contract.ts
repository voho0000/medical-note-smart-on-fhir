/**
 * The host's reading of the structured questions and the diagnostic summary a
 * recommendation carries.
 *
 * The shapes are the pack's own. `@voho0000/personalized-care` 2.0.0 publishes
 * `CdssPhysicianInputRequest`, `CdssDiagnosticSummary` and the rest, and the
 * names below are aliases of them, so a rename in the pack is a compile error
 * here rather than a control that quietly stops rendering.
 *
 * What is still the host's own work is the reading. `physicianInputRequestsOf`
 * and `diagnosticSummaryOf` validate what arrives rather than casting it: both
 * fields are optional on a recommendation, and the app runs against more than
 * one build of the pack — the published package on `master`, and on `app-hmc`
 * the HMC preview, which overlays the pilot's compiled modules onto the
 * published package and keeps the published declarations. An overlaid module's
 * behaviour reaches the app while a field the pilot added does not reach its
 * types, so what actually arrives is checked. An unrecognised `kind` is
 * dropped, which is how a pack newer than this host renders nothing instead of
 * an empty control.
 *
 * The term constants are the other direction: the ids the host writes back as
 * facts. They are wire identifiers the pack matches on, never clinical
 * wording, and the precedent is `apply-clinic-vitals.ts`, which names the
 * congestion term ids (`pitting-edema`, `orthopnea`, …) the same way. What
 * stays with the pack is what matters clinically: every label on screen is the
 * pack's own wording, carried inside the recommendation.
