/**
 * Where this feature's per-patient answers are kept, and on what terms.
 *
 * Everything the clinician answers in the room — the measurements, the NYHA
 * grade, the phenotype, the decisions, the echo values typed off a report — is
 * patient data. It used to be written to `localStorage` as plain JSON, which
 * meant the next person at a shared clinic workstation could read the previous
 * patient's answers out of the browser. That is the finding CodeQL raised as
 * `js/clear-text-storage-of-sensitive-data`, and this module is the answer to
 * it: every value goes through the same envelope the imported bundle and the AI
 * result caches already use — AES-GCM under the tab-session key from
 * `bundle-crypto`, ciphertext in `localStorage`.
 *
 * Two consequences, both accepted:
 *
 * - **The answers live for the tab session.** They survive a reload, because
 *   the key lives in `sessionStorage`; a new tab or a new session cannot
 *   decrypt them, and `loadEncryptedCache` purges what it cannot read.
 * - **Carrying an answer across visits is phase 2.** That needs a server-side
 *   store with its own path, expiry and Rules (see
 *   `docs/HF-DP01_phenotype-answer-persistence-proposal.md`), not a longer-lived
 *   browser key.
 *
 * Decryption is asynchronous, so every hydration is too. What is *not*
 * asynchronous is a save: callers update their in-memory state first and hand
 * the value here, which encrypts and writes in the background. A write that
 * cannot be made leaves the in-memory answer untouched — storage is a cache,
 * never the source of clinical truth.
