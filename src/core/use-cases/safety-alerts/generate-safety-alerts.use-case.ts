// rating common, usually-appropriate geriatric prescribing (e.g. an
// anticholinergic BPH/OAB drug in an older man, which is near-universal and
// usually necessary) as high-risk trains clinicians to ignore every alert
// (alert fatigue) and buries the genuinely dangerous ones (user report

const SEVERITY_RULE =
  ' Severity standard — the ONLY test for "high" is TIME-TO-HARM, not how serious the topic sounds: ' +

  'Typical "high" cases: a critical / panic lab value; active bleeding risk on multiple antithrombotics; a drug given despite a DOCUMENTED allergy; a drug outright contraindicated at this patient\'s CURRENT organ function with active accumulation; a dangerous, acute interaction. ' +
  'Everything that is a REVIEW item — worth checking but NOT about to cause harm in the near term — is "medium" at most, even when the topic sounds important: anticholinergic / Beers burden, polypharmacy, therapeutic duplication of ordinary drugs, a renally-dosed drug that is merely "worth confirming", mildly-abnormal or chronic-stable labs, monitoring gaps. If the recommendation is 「建議評估 / 追蹤 / 留意 / 可考慮」, the alert is by definition NOT high. ' +
  'Use "low" for purely informational points. ' +
  'Default to "medium". Do NOT inflate severity just because the patient is elderly or multimorbid. Most patients have ZERO or ONE "high"; if several alerts look "high", re-apply the time-to-harm test and downgrade the ones that fail — a scan where everything is high trains clinicians to ignore all of them.'

// Appended to both prompts. "title", "detail" and "recommendation" are
// SEPARATE UI fields shown in a fixed layout — a positional cross-reference
// like 「如果有上述情形」 can point the WRONG way (the symptoms it means live in

  ' Never use a positional cross-reference (上述 / 下述 / 如上 / 如下 / above / below / as follows) to point from one field ("title" / "detail" / "recommendation") at another — they are separate UI blocks in a fixed layout, so "as above" may point the wrong way. Make each field self-contained: if the recommendation refers to symptoms or items, restate them briefly rather than saying 上述/下述.'

// Appended to both prompts: how to cite the SOURCE LIST in "sources".
const SOURCE_RULE =
  ' In "sources", list the SOURCE LIST key(s) (e.g. "L3", "M2") for the records this alert is based on; ' +
  'use ONLY keys that appear in the SOURCE LIST, and omit any you cannot match. This is separate from "evidence" (which stays human-readable). ' +
  'When an alert relies on a discharge summary or other clinical document, cite its matching D# source key.'

const DOCUMENT_EVIDENCE_RULE =
  ' Clinical-document evidence: a diagnosis explicitly written in a discharge summary is valid evidence even if there is no separate endoscopy, pathology, or imaging resource; do NOT reject it merely because a standalone report is absent. ' +
  'But a documented diagnosis does NOT prove that a particular procedure was performed. State that the document records the diagnosis, and claim gastroscopy/endoscopy/biopsy only if the document text itself explicitly says it was performed.'

// Appended to both prompts. The data is Taiwan NHI 健康存摺 — cross-facility
// insurance records where ONE prescription is recorded twice (the prescribing
// clinic AND the 藥局 that dispenses the 慢箋). Without this rule the model
// flags every pharmacy-dispensed chronic script as "duplicate therapy" —
// constant false alarms (user report 2026-07-07).

// Appended to both prompts. A run built a "watch your blood pressure" reminder
// on a 154 mmHg reading that was 8 YEARS old (2018), calling it 「最新」 — stale
// vitals must not masquerade as current, and must not anchor health advice.

  'Do not pair an old reading with a recent one as if they were measured together.'

// Appended to both prompts. Flash-Lite labelled tamsulosin (α-blocker) and
// mosapride (prokinetic) "anticholinergic" while missing the true ones
// (imipramine, tolterodine) — a clinician reader loses trust instantly.
const DRUG_PROPERTY_RULE =

const DUPLICATE_RULE =
  ' Duplicate-medication rule (health-record context) — apply it strictly: these are cross-facility insurance records, so ONE prescription can appear multiple times. ' +
  'To judge duplication, look ONLY at the PRESCRIBING facilities (clinics / hospitals). IGNORE every PHARMACY row (機構名含 藥局 / 藥房) — a pharmacy does not prescribe, it only DISPENSES / 釋出 a 慢箋, so it can NEVER be one of the duplicate sources and must NEVER appear in the "evidence". ' +
  'Repeat fills of the same drug from the SAME clinic over time are one ongoing therapy — NOT duplicate. ' +
  'Flag "duplicate" ONLY when the SAME drug — or two drugs of the same class with additive effect — was prescribed by TWO DIFFERENT CLINICS whose supply windows OVERLAP (so the patient could be taking a doubled dose). ' +
  'When you flag it, "evidence" MUST name those two DIFFERENT prescribing CLINICS with their dates (never a pharmacy), ' +

  'Do NOT tie a past frightening event (confusion, a fall, a hospital visit) to a current medicine as cause-and-effect, and do NOT say a medicine "may worsen / affect / 加重" a serious symptom — that frightens people and can make them stop a medicine they actually need. ' +
  'Instead, note neutrally that this is simply something doctors routinely review in older adults, that the medicine may well be the right choice for them, and that the doctor will judge whether any adjustment is needed. ' +
  'These are things to discuss, not diagnoses or dangers. ' +
  'Above all, choose wording that does NOT make the patient anxious, fearful, or panicked (用詞避免引起病患恐慌或焦慮): stay calm, matter-of-fact and reassuring; avoid frightening, urgent, or worst-case phrasing and scary symptom names in headings. ' +
  'For a medication-review item, NEVER output a contentless "ask your doctor whether this medicine is still right for you" — the prescriber chose that medicine deliberately, and a patient showing up with a reason-free query wastes the visit and undermines trust in the prescription. ' +
  'Either make it SYMPTOM-CONDITIONAL — name concrete signs the patient can watch for (e.g. 口乾、便祕、頭暈、記憶變差) and say to MENTION them at the next visit ONLY IF they occur, otherwise keep taking the medicine as usual — or OMIT the item (the clinician-facing scan already covers prescriber-side review).
